**Summary: we're excited to announce Infracost v0.9.16 and our new composable GitLab CI template ðŸŽ‰. This release also includes a quick way to share cost estimates and 10 new AWS/Azure/Google resources. We recommend everyone to [upgrade](/docs/#1-install-infracost)!**

<!--truncate-->

### Share cost estimates

Cost estimates can now be shared with other team members or management without having to manually upload files to object storage! See [this example](https://dashboard.infracost.io/share/deaczrvclzv9z8yf76dex0t4dpxx9buj).

The Infracost dashboard is part of our hosted services and you can enable it by running:
```sh
# in CLI:
infracost configureÂ setÂ enable_dashboard true

# in CI/CD:
export INFRACOST_ENABLE_DASHBOARD=true
```

Once enabled, the Infracost CLI sends its [JSON output](/docs/features/cli_commands/#examples) to the dashboard so it can generate unique share links. The Infracost JSON output does not contain any cloud credentials or secrets. The link is also included in the Infracost JSON output so it can be parsed and used in your workflow, for example by sending it to Slack.

### New Infracost Docker image

We've created new smaller Docker images without the multiple Terraform or Terragrunt binaries. The new images only include the Infracost CLI, [Compost](https://github.com/infracost/compost) and helper bash scripts. This enables you to use official Terraform/Terragrunt images alongside Infracost in any CI/CD system:

- `infracost/infracost:ci-0.9` (recommended) - Always use the latest 0.9.x version to pick up bug fixes and new resources.
- `infracost/infracost:ci-0.9.16` - Lock to v0.9.16.
- `infracost/infracost:ci-latest` - Always use the latest Infracost image. This might break when new minor or major versions are released.

### New composable GitLab CI template

The new [Infracost GitLab CI template](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci/) provides a composable way of using Infracost in your workflow. The new template enables you to use the latest backward compatible version of Infracost, and comment on merge requests using different behaviors so you can control the noise level (e.g. always update the same comment).

If you used our old [template](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci/-/blob/master/infracost.yml), please follow [our migration guide](/docs/guides/gitlab_ci_migration/). The old template is deprecated but will continue to work without issues.

### New resources

We added support for 10 new resources:

- AWS: `aws_cloudtrail` and the new Indonesia region (ap-southeast-3)  
- Azure: `azurerm_sql_database`, `azurerm_virtual_wan`, `azurerm_virtual_hub`, `azurerm_vpn_gateway`, `azurerm_point_to_site_vpn_gateway`, `azurerm_express_route_gateway`, `azurerm_vpn_gateway_connection`, `azurerm_express_route_connection`
- Google: `google_artifact_registry_repository`

### Faster runs

Using Infracost with a [config-file](/docs/features/config_file/) now runs a lot faster as we process the projects in parallel.

### TLS options for self-hosted Cloud Pricing API

The Cloud Pricing API now supports skipping certificate verification (useful for testing) and using a [self-signed certificate](/docs/cloud_pricing_api/self_hosted/#using-a-self-signed-certificate).

### Terragrunt

Terragrunt CLI flags can now be passed through the `INFRACOST_TERRAGRUNT_FLAGS` environment variable:

```
INFRACOST_TERRAGRUNT_FLAGS="--terragrunt-exclude-dir dev" infracost breakdown --path /path/to/terragrunt/code
```

We've also fixed an issue that was causing problems for tgenv users (used to handle multiple versions of Terragrunt), though we recommend using [tgswitch](https://warrensbox.github.io/tgswitch/) as tgenv no longer seems to be maintained.

### Community highlights

We'd like to give a shout-out to:
- Our friends at [Scalr](https://www.scalr.com) who announced their native Infracost [integration](https://www.scalr.com/blog/infracost)! Scalr enable companies to decentralize their Terraform operations.
- [Josh Niec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshniec/) who added a resource mapping. 
- Kanishk Agrawal who wrote a [blog](https://blog.clairvoyantsoft.com/terraform-pull-request-automation-using-atlantis-and-infracost-864d7a89fd45) about Terraform pull request automation using Atlantis and Infracost.

Finally, [Hugo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-rut-13111680/), who was a regular contributor, has joined our team!

### Help us!

Up next, we're focusing on composable Azure DevOps integration, more [seamless integration](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/discussions/1955) with Atlantis and improving our CLI to CI flow. You keep sharing your feedback and we'll keep shipping ðŸš€

Message me on [Slack](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alikhajeh) if you have any questions!
